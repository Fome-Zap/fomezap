**Title (draft):** FomeZap — Multi-tenant SaaS Digital Menu Platform

**Abstract:**

FomeZap is a SaaS platform designed to enable restaurants and food establishments to create and manage personalized digital menus, supporting routing by subdomains or slugs, WhatsApp integration for order submission (WHATSAPP, 2025), and an administrative panel for managing products, categories, and orders. The system is implemented with a multi-tenant architecture to ensure data isolation per tenant (FOWLER, 2002) and uses a modern stack composed of Node.js/Express in the backend (NODE.JS, 2024), MongoDB (Mongoose) as the database (MONGODB, 2024), and React (Vite) in the frontend (REACT, 2024).

The project includes core MVP features: a responsive customer interface, a cart system with local persistence, product extras management, WhatsApp-based order finalization, and image upload/processing. On the backend, schemas were created for Tenant, Category, Product, Extra, and Order, along with management routes and public endpoints.

This thesis documents the requirements analysis, software architecture, technology selection, implementation of key features, validation testing, and proposals for future work (online payments, tenant analytics, template system, and full admin authentication).
